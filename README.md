<h3>
What is it?
</h3>
This software converts midi signals into commands that can be understood by the Piano Rooms Roblox game, these commands are simply raw text of the type of command, the channel, and the velocity.
<h3>
Installation
</h3>
Windows:<br>
In the root folder there is a stand alone executable.
<br><br>
Don't trust me? I wouldn't either, if you are that way inclined the python source code is available in the MidiConnectSource folder, message me if you need help getting it to run.
